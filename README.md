# my_blog

Welcome to **my_blog**, my first Django project! This project allows users to view the latest blog posts, store posts to read later, and comment on posts. It's a simple, user-friendly blog platform that I built as a follow-along project from Academind.

## Features

- **View Latest Posts**: Browse through the latest blog posts.
- **Read Later**: Save blog posts for reading later.
- **Comment on Posts**: Leave comments on blog posts to engage with the content.

## Hosted Live

You can access the live version of this project here: [my_blog on Vercel](https://blog-plum-mu-98.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: The backend framework used for handling the server-side logic.
- **SQLite**: The default database used for development.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the front-end user interface.
- **Vercel**: For hosting and deploying the application.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_blog.git
